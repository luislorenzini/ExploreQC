# ExploreQC
ExploreQC toolbox for QC of MRI data in multicenter and multimodal cohorts

Companion code of Lorenzini et al. "The European Prevention of Alzheimerâ€™s Dementia (EPAD) Neuroimaging Dataset and Processing Workflow", detailing the methodological implementation for the processing and QC of MRI scans in the EPAD cohort.

This set of scripts is specifically thought to be used for replicating the semi-automated QC strategy demonstrated in the paper to:

Compute QC metrics on EPAD scans
Interactively visualize QC distributions within and between scans
As described in the manuscript and supplementary materials, the user should first specify the needed setting in the config.xlsx file.

THIS IS A FIXED RELEASE! This folder won't be updated in the future as it reports the codes that have been used during the preparation of the manuscript. 
Any enquiry about the code and its application on other MRI dataset can be send to l.lorenzini@amsterdamumc.nl
